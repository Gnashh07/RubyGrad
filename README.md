This is RubyGrad. An implementation of Micrograd by @Karpathy in Ruby.

Similar to Micrograd, Rubygrad is able to achieve backpropagtion and also predict small dataset of values.

Theres a file called as test_code_for_rubygrad.rb , where there are two sets of codes that you can run along with rubygrad.rb to test whether the functionalities are being implemented.

****IMPORTANT: To generate graphs it is important to have the graphviz gem and also make sure that you have graphviz software installed in your system and set as a path.

PS: If you come up with any bugs in the code, feel free to raise a PR and i will merge it.

Happy coding.
